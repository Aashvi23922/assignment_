With HTML constructs,images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br />HTML provides a means to create Structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <b><i>headlings,paragraphs,lists,quotes and other items.</i></b></br>HTML elements are delineated by tags,written using <u>angle brackets.</u> such as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
   <br> Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
